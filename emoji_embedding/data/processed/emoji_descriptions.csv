Sport Utility Vehicle or SUV is an emoji whose meaning was likely lost in translation as it moved from Japanese phone carriers to the Unicode Standard in 2010.
This emoji goes back to the late 1990s when it was included in Docomo's emoji set.

In that proposal, the symbol was referred to as a ""recreational vehicle"" or RV. The original Japanese emojis look more like station wagons or SUVs than RVs.
